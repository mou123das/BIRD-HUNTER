# What is Pygame?
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.<br>
<br>
Pygame uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, with the intention of allowing real-time computer game development without the low-level mechanics of the C programming language and its derivatives. This is based on the assumption that the most expensive functions inside games can be abstracted from the game logic, making it possible to use a high-level programming language, such as Python, to structure the game.<br><br>

# About the game
This game is pretty straight forward. Imagine you are a ninja and you will have to kill the birds to earn points. If you are able to kill all the 8 birds, you win the game else if any of the birds crosses the violet line, the game will end.<br>
The game is menu based, to the guide the user through the program.
